- code can get messy from too many class names and types

- integer has only .value
- no value can exist alone, must be passed as an instance on integer class

- no class has an attribute that exists solely as a noncustom class (**EXECEPT .value
WHICH CONVERTS CUSTOM CLASSES TO REGULAR VALUES**)

- only one .value should ever be used in a input line because of custom class conversion

- fractions auto simplify when converted from decimals and when declared as an instance of a class

- (???) reorganize classes to be more neat and maintain mutually exclusive imports
